# PathGUI

The field is from the 2018 FRC season.

The program takes the mouse position on the field drawn in the GUI and then based off of that, when the mouse button is clicked, it prompts the user for a desired heading, velocity and acceleration for that point and then adds that point to a series of points and generates a path accordingly. The path generation is based of cubic spline interpolation.
